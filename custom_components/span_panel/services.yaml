cleanup_energy_spikes:
  name: Cleanup Energy Spikes
  description: >
    Detect and remove negative energy spikes from all SPAN energy sensors caused by panel
    firmware updates or resets. Uses the main meter to detect reset timestamps where the

    All SPAN energy sensor entries at those timestamps will be deleted.
  fields:

      description: Number of days in the past to scan for spikes. Defaults to 1 (last 24 hours).

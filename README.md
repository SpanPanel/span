# Span HACS

Basic, and very definitely experimental, [HACS integration](https://hacs.xyz/) for the [Span smart panel](https://www.span.io/panel).

This integration should not have any negative impact on your Span installation, but as Span has not published a documented API, we absolutely cannot guarantee this will work for you, or that will not break.
The author(s) will try to keep this integration working, but cannot provide technical support for either Span or your homes electrical system.

# Contributing & Issues

If you have a problem, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/gdgib/span-hacs/issues), but please know issues regarding your network, Span configuration, or home electrical system are outside of our purview.
For those capable, please consider opening even a low quality [pull request](https://github.com/gdgib/span-hacs/pulls) when possible, as we're generally very happy to have a starting point when making a change.

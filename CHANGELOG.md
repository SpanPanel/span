# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.3] - 2025-01-XX

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Migration Entity ID Validation**: Fixed migration errors where entity IDs containing parentheses or hyphens (like panel serial numbers) would fail schema  
  validation due to erroneous use of the device serial number. The migration process now preserves existing entity IDs exactly as they were originally created
  instead of attempting to sanitize them.

  If you previously migrated and encountered an error, go back to 1.0.10 by restoring your backup. Do NOT attempt to overlay this repository over a corrupted
  install. If you have a courrpted install and don't want to restore a backup you must first delete the SPAN configuration entry and reboot first.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-XX

‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR UPGRADE WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è

**Before upgrading to version 1.2.2, please backup your Home Assistant configuration and database.** This version introduces significant architectural changes.
While we've implemented migration logic to preserve your existing entities and automations, it's always recommended to have a backup before major upgrades.

### üöÄ Features

#### Synthetic Sensors Engine

- **Synthetic Sensors**: Integration now leverages a [synthetic sensor engine](https://github.com/LegoTypes/ha-synthetic-sensors) that allows features beyond
  basic sensors. We will leverage the use of these smart sensors in the future to allow users to modify sensors calculations or create meaning full groups.
- **Grace Period Algorithm**: Developed by @sargonas, keeps statistics from reporting wild spikes and gaps during intermittent outages by providing the previous
  known good value for a grace period
- **Voltage and Amperage Attributes**: Added attributes for voltage and amperage to each power sensor for threshold automations
- **Panel Tabs Attributes**: Added attribute to each sensor to see the specific panel tabs (spaces) associated with sensor
- **Unmapped Tab Sensors**: Added hidden circuits for tabs that are no part of a circuit reported directly by the panel. The user may make these tabs sensors
  visisble.
- **Panel Offline Sensor**: Added a sensor that indicates whether the panel is offline (cannot return data to the integration)
- **State Visibility**: Attributes show you the formula used in the sensor calculation for grace periods and net energy
- **Net Energy Sensors**: New net energy sensors calculate `consumed energy - produced energy` for circuits, panels, and tab-based solar installations,
  providing real-time net energy consumption/generation data
- **Sensor Configuration Export**: You can export the sensor configuration (import/modification not supported yet)
- **Panel Simulation**: You can clone your own panel or set up a simulation for energy usage based on predefined patterns. You can also take the panel offline
  to see how the grace periods for energy respond. We may extend this feature in order to allow modeling of energy usage or integration with other sensors or
  utilities.

#### OpenAPI Support

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Integration now uses the OpenAPI specification provided by the SPAN panel for reliable foundation
- **Future Interface Changes**: Provides reliable foundation for future interface changes

#### Simulation Support

- **Virtual Panel Templates**: Support for adding configuration entries for virtual panels based on templates that produce typical power and energy
- **Import/Export Profiles**: You can import or export the simulation profile and even clone your existing panel
- **Custom Profile Building**: See the simulation [guide](https://github.com/SpanPanel/span-panel-api/blob/main/docs/simulation.md) on how to build your own
  profile

#### Network Configuration

- **Configurable Timeouts and Retries**: Connection options for different network environments
  - **Timeout Settings**: Customize connection and request timeouts for slower networks
  - **Retry Configuration**: Configure automatic retry attempts for transient network issues
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Added SSL support for remote panel access scenarios
  - **Local Access**: Standard HTTP connection for panels on local network
  - **Remote Access**: HTTPS support for accessing panels through secure proxies

#### Circuit Management

- **Circuit Name Sync**: Automatic friendly name updates when circuits are renamed in the SPAN panel
- **Custom Name Preservation**: Custom entity friendly names in Home Assistant are preserved and won't be overwritten during sync
- **Re-enable Sync**: Clear custom name in Home Assistant to re-enable sync for customized entities

#### Entity Naming Patterns

- **Configurable Entity Naming**: Provides configurable entity naming patterns upon initial setup
- **Friendly Names Pattern**: Entity IDs use descriptive circuit names (e.g., `sensor.span_panel_kitchen_outlets_power`)
- **Circuit Numbers Pattern**: Entity IDs use stable circuit numbers (e.g., `sensor.span_panel_circuit_15_power`)
- **Pattern Selection**: Choose between friendly names (recommended for new installations) or circuit numbers (stable entity IDs)

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Migration Support

- **Schema Migration**: Latest version changes the underlying configuration schema and migrates unique keys
- **Entity ID Preservation**: Existing entity IDs are kept intact during migration
- **Legacy Support**: Pre-1.0.4 installations can only migrate forward to friendly names with device prefixes

#### Solar Configuration

- **Tab-Based Solar**: Solar configuration for solar directly connected to panel tabs
- **Four Solar Sensors**: Power, produced energy, consumed energy, and net energy sensors
- **Dual Circuit Support**: Support for single and dual circuit solar configurations
- **Dynamic Entity Naming**: Entity naming follows configured naming pattern (circuit numbers or friendly names)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- **Major Architectural Changes**: Version 1.2.0 introduces significant architectural changes
- **Backup Required**: Users must backup Home Assistant configuration and database before upgrading
- **Migration Required**: Existing installations require migration to new schema

### üìù Documentation

- **Simulation Guide**: Documentation for building custom simulation profiles
- **Troubleshooting Section**: Enhanced troubleshooting information

### üîÑ HACS Upgrade Process

This integration should handle migrating your entities seamlessly. Any entity ID's or names should be retained. We do migrate all the unique keys by properly
renaming these in the entity registry so the user should not see any difference.

- **Backup Instructions**: Check backup requirements before upgrade
- **Automation Verification**: Check automations for correct entity ID references
